Adapted from https://gist.github.com/Abizern/a81f31a75e1ad98ff80d

Prints the filename, function name, line number and textual representation of `object` and a newline character into
the standard output if the build setting for "Other Swift Flags" defines `-D DEBUG`.

Only the first parameter needs to be passed to this funtion.

The textual representation is obtained from the `message` using its protocol conformances, in the following
order of preference: `Streamable`, `Printable`, `DebugPrintable`. Do not overload this function for your type.
Instead, adopt one of the protocols mentioned above.

:param: message   The object whose textual representation will be printed. If this is an expression, it is lazily evaluated.
:param: file     The name of the file, defaults to the current file without the ".swift" extension.
:param: function The name of the function, defaults to the function within which the call is made.
:param: line     The line number, defaults to the line number within the file that the call is made.
